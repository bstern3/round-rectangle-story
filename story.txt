I went to work today. I work at Google in Madison. You could say I have a pretty cool job. Everyday, I bike to work. Google's Madison location is small but cool; there's sleeping pods and fun themed rooms. I'm a software engineer there and it's super fun! However, the work load can get to be too much sometimes.
