I went to work today. I work at Google in Madison. You could say I have a pretty cool job. Everyday, I bike to work. Google's Madison location is small but cool; there's sleeping pods and fun themed rooms. I'm a software engineer there and it's super fun! However, the work load can get to be too much sometimes. Last week I had to write 5000000 lines of code. It was alot of work but I got a raise for doing such a good job. I hope one day to run my own company.
That's why I work really hard at work. While it is nice to relax once in a while, often times I can be found in my seat, typing away. Coding can be stressful, though, so some times I go sleep or to the themed rooms.
